	<h1>Split-brain</h1>

	<p>Split-brain or callosal syndrome is a type of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disconnection_syndrome">disconnection 	syndrome</a> when the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corpus_callosum"><i class="brain component">corpus callosum</i></a>	connecting the two <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebral_hemisphere">hemispheres of the brain</a> is severed to some 	degree. It is an association of symptoms produced by disruption of, or interference with, the connection between the hemispheres 	of the brain. The surgical operation to produce this condition (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corpus_callosotomy">corpus 	callosotomy</a>) involves transection of the <i class="brain component">corpus callosum</i>, and is usually a last resort to treat 	refractory <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epilepsy">epilepsy</a>. Initially, partial callosotomies are performed; if this 	operation does not succeed, a complete callosotomy is performed to mitigate the risk of accidental physical injury by reducing the 	severity and violence of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seizure">epileptic seizures</a>. Before using callosotomies, 	epilepsy is instead treated through pharmaceutical means. After surgery, neuropsychological assessments are often performed.</p>

	<p>After the right and left brain are separated, each hemisphere will have its own separate <strong>perception, concepts, and 	impulses to act</strong>. Having two "brains" in one body can create some interesting dilemmas. When one split-brain patient 	dressed himself, he sometimes pulled his pants up with one hand (that side of his brain wanted to get dressed) and down with the 	other (this side did not). He also reported to have grabbed his wife with his left hand and shaken her violently, at which point 	his right hand came to her aid and grabbed the aggressive left hand. However, such conflicts are very rare. If a conflict arises, 	one hemisphere usually overrides the other.[1]</p>

	<p>When split-brain patients are shown an image only in the left half of each eye's visual field, they cannot vocally name what 	they have seen. This is because the image seen in the left visual field is sent only to the right side of the brain (see <a 	href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optic_tract">optic tract</a>), and <a 	href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lateralization_of_brain_function">most people's speech-control center is on the left side of 	the brain</a>. Communication between the two sides is inhibited, so the patient cannot say out loud the name of that which the 	right side of the brain is seeing. A similar effect occurs if a split-brain patient touches an object with only the left hand 	while receiving no visual cues in the right visual field; the patient will be unable to name the object, as each cerebral 	hemisphere of the primary <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somatosensory_system#Somatosensory_cortex">somatosensory 	cortex</a> only contains a tactile representation of the opposite side of the body. If the speech-control center is on the right 	side of the brain, the same effect can be achieved by presenting the image or object to only the right visual field or 	hand.[citation needed]</p>

	<p>The same effect occurs for visual pairs and reasoning. For example, a patient with split brain is shown a picture of a chicken 	foot and a snowy field in separate visual fields and asked to choose from a list of words the best association with the pictures. 	The patient would choose a chicken to associate with the chicken foot and a shovel to associate with the snow; however, when asked 	to reason why the patient chose the shovel, the response would relate to the chicken (e.g. "the shovel is for cleaning out the 	chicken coop").[2]</p>
